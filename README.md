# Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Excel Dashboard)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bank customer data to identify patterns and indicators of customer churn. Using Excel’s Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, the analysis highlights key factors influencing customer attrition and provides insights that can support retention strategies.

The dashboard presents a clear visual summary of churn trends across different customer segments, helping decision-makers quickly understand where to focus retention efforts.

## Objectives
* Identify key characteristics of customers who are likely to churn.
* Compare churn behavior across demographics and account types.
* Build an interactive dashboard for quick business insights.
* Support data-driven customer retention strategies.

## Tools & Techniques Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables
* Pivot Charts
* Slicers for interactive filtering
* Basic data cleaning and transformation

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized bank customer records with fields such as:

* Customer ID
* Age
* Gender
* Geography
* Account balance
* Tenure
* Number of products
* Credit score
* Active status
* Churn status

## Key Analysis Performed
The following analyses were conducted using Pivot Tables:

1. Churn rate by age group
2. Churn by account balance range
3. Churn by number of products
4. Churn comparison by gender and geography
5. Active vs inactive customer churn patterns

## Dashboard Features
* Interactive slicers for:

  * Gender
  * Geography
  * Age group
* Pivot charts showing:

  * Churn distribution
  * Segment comparisons
  * Key churn drivers

## Key Insights
* Customers with lower product engagement showed higher churn rates.
* Inactive customers were significantly more likely to churn.
* Certain age groups and regions had higher attrition patterns.
* Customers with very high or very low balances showed distinct churn behaviors.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis:

* Implement targeted retention campaigns for high-risk segments.
* Increase engagement for customers with only one product.
* Introduce loyalty or relationship-based incentives.
